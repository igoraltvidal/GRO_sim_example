# GRO_sim_example

This is just a simple GRO simulation example. GRO (The Cell programming language) simulates the behavior of cells in growing microcolonies of microorganisms
[About GRO: http://depts.washington.edu/soslab/gro/index.html]. This simulation is a project for the signature Programmable Biology, from the Artifcial Intelligence Master. 
The simulations has the goal to solve 3 different types of problems:

* The minimum distance between groups problem
* Increasing the distance between groups
* Creating groups with similar number of cells

The first simulation has the intention to create microcolonies with a small distance between each other. The 2ยบ and 3ยบ simulation are a improvement of the first simulation.
It was used the LIA-GRO version of the simulator [https://github.com/liaupm/GRO-LIA] to run the files. A python script is attached here to plot the data from the simulations.

## Example

Bellow we can see an example of the simulation of the "Creating groups with similar number of cells" problem and the plot results.
